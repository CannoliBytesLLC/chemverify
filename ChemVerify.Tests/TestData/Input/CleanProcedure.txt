To a solution of 4-bromoanisole (1.87 g, 10 mmol) and phenylboronic acid (1.34 g, 11 mmol) in THF (20 mL) was added Pd(PPh3)4 (0.23 g, 0.2 mmol, 2 mol%). The mixture was heated to 80 °C under nitrogen for 12 h. The reaction was quenched with saturated NH4Cl (10 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 15 mL). The combined organic phases were dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification by column chromatography (hexanes/EtOAc 9:1) afforded 4-methoxybiphenyl (1.70 g, 92% yield) as a white solid (DOI: 10.1021/ja00269a018).
